# MockUI_StackExchange

The application uses react navigation for tab based screen routing.
Each screen makes an API call to stack exchange for fetching hot questions based on tag values.
Currently the API pagination works when tried with official docs of stack exchange but returns the same value in mobile app even when querying with different page numbers.
